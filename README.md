## üçÉ Ponytown Info

Please whisper me if you want to crown me or interact, I am very often AFK or busy on my other monitor  
I rarely talk to anybody I don't know, please do not start up a conversation with me if I don't know you well!  
I prefer not to be kissed or booped by those I don't know, not because of touch discomforts, just because I'm bad at interacting with others  
I love joining regis/scouts/species, if you are in any that have cute unis and a friendly vibe, I'm always open to reccommendations!
